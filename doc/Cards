The Sum of Attack and Health must be within the range {(2*Cost) - 1, (2*Cost) + 1} 
For example, a fair 3-cost card could be a 4,2, a 3,2, or a 3,4.    but if it were a 1,2 or a 4,5 it would be imbalanced

The Cards that do not have an attack/health, but only an effect, are "spell" cards. The rest are regular cards that 
are placed onto the board. 

Let's try and add more to this existing deck.  Ideally we would aim to have around 50-60 different cards, so 
that players' decks will have a high chance of being vastly different from one another.

If you want to add a card, keep in mind that its effect must be balanced with other card values.  Or just add 
an idea for a card without any values if you just want to jot an idea down.
